1. The former experiment:
    BERT-embedding + Bilinear fusion for VA and QA + 4 layers
   does not result in good performance. The model meets with overfitting at epoch 10. The highest accuracy is Ã—64.11% (TBD) at validation set
   
2. Therefore, I changed the model:
   2.1 Increase the kernel size of bilinear fusion via tucker decomposition from 200 to 512 (Increasing the generalization)
   2.2 Add no_grad() to word embedding (Including positional embedding and segment embedding)
   2.3 Increase the number of layers from 4 to 8.

3. Implementing a new idea on the IDEATION clause 6
