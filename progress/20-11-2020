1. Test two experiment results.

1.1 MCAN with modified GA. Modified GA Unit exchanges the K,V and Q so that K and V are derived from image and Q are derived from question. 
    Meanwhile, a linear mapping layer (Linear + ReLU) is added to the end of it in order to maintain the dimension the same as image.
    What's more, the input image features are added by the bounding box embeddings, instead of concatenating them.
    
    The performance decreases. Accuracy on Val set is 63.32%, on Test-dev set is 64.89%.

1.2 Modified MMNASNET. Perform the same as 1.1.
    The performance decreases. Accuracy on Val set is 62.07%, on Test-dev set is 63.34%.
    One thing to note is: The accuracy decreases on the val set after 10 epochs. 
    It seems that overfitting occurs.
