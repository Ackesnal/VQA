1. The modified Guided Attention (GA) does not result in better performance. Accuracy on VQAv2 validation set is 61.98%

2. Since the training seemed not to converge, I turned down the lr to 1e-7 and set the training epochs to 20.

3. Based on 2, the validation accuracy increases slowly. A much lower lr may not be a good idea.
   It stuck at 49% accuracy.

4. The experiments made before are based on MMNASNET, which contains the combination of SA, GA, FFN, RSA. 
   I think it is hard to see whether the modified GA works better than the original one on MMNASNET.
   Therefore, I turn back to the MCAN, and change the SGA unit in MCAN.
   I plan to see whether the modified GA works better than original GA under the same configuration.

5. Ask Lars about the next steps
